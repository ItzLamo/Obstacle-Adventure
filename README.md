# Obstacle-Adventure
My first game ever, learning for the Highseas High Club
Description:

"Obstacle Adventure" is an exciting 2D game built using Pygame, where the player controls a rocket-shaped character and navigates through a series of obstacles falling from the top of the screen. The objective is to avoid the obstacles while trying to score points by surviving longer. The game gets progressively harder as the player advances, with obstacles appearing faster and in greater numbers.

The game features:

Rocket-shaped Player: A custom rocket image is used as the player character, which moves left, right, up, and down to avoid obstacles.
Varied Obstacles: Obstacles come in different shapes (circles, squares, and triangles) and fall from the top of the screen at varying speeds.
Increasing Difficulty: As the player earns points, the speed and number of obstacles increase, making the game more challenging.
Game Over State: The game ends if the player collides with an obstacle, and the final score is displayed.
Sound Effects: Enjoy background music, collision sounds, and game over sounds to enhance the gaming experience.
Technologies Used:

Pygame: For creating the graphical interface and game mechanics.
Python: For the game logic and scripting.
Custom Images: Custom PNG files are used for the player rocket and obstacle shapes.
This game is a fun and engaging way to test reflexes and coordination, with the added challenge of increasing difficulty as you progress.
